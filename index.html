      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi! I'm Chris. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Journalism. During my undergraduate years, I was immersed in the world of media and communication,
        learning about how to report news and tell stories.</p>
      <p>However, now I've made a big leap and am currently studying Computer Science as a cross-disciplinary pursuit. It's been an exciting and challenging journey so far.</p>
      <p>In my free time, I have a variety of hobbies. I absolutely love traveling. New places, experiencing different cultures, and meeting new people are things that truly
        enrich my life. I'm also a huge fan of KPOP. The energetic music and amazing choreography always get me pumped up.</p>
      <p>And of course, I enjoy indulging in delicious food. Whether it's a local specialty or an international cuisine, I'm always eager to taste and savor it. That's a
        little bit about me!</p>
