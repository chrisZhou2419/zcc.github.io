        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Chris. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Journalism.During my undergraduate years, I was immersed in the world of media and communication,/
            learning about how to report news and tell stories. However, now I've made a big leap and am currently studying Computer Science as a cross-disciplinary pursuit./
            It's been an exciting and challenging journey so far./
            
            In my free time, I have a variety of hobbies. I absolutely love traveling new places, experiencing different cultures, and meeting new people are things that 
            truly enrich my life. I'm also a huge fan of KPOP. The energetic music and amazing choreography always get me pumped up.
            
            And of course, I enjoy indulging in delicious food. Whether it's a local specialty or an international cuisine, I'm always eager to taste and savor it./ 
            That's a little bit about me!</p>
